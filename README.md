Nuclei is a fast tool for configurable targeted scanning based on templates offering massive extensibility and ease of use. 

Nuclei is used to send requests across targets based on a template leading to zero false positives and providing effective scanning for known paths. Main use cases for nuclei are during initial reconnaissance phase to quickly check for low hanging fruits or CVEs across targets that are known and easily detectable. It uses [retryablehttp-go library](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/retryablehttp-go) designed to handle various errors and retries in case of blocking by WAFs, this is also one of our core modules from custom-queries.

We have also [open-sourced a dedicated repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) to maintain various type of templates, we hope that you will contribute there too. Templates are provided in hopes that these will be useful and will allow everyone to build their own templates for the scanner. Checkout the templating guide at [**nuclei.projectdiscovery.io**](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) for a primer on nuclei templates.

# Installation Instructions


### From Binary

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```bash
https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases
tar -xzvf nuclei-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/
nuclei -h
```

### From Source

nuclei requires **go1.14+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```bash
> GO111MODULE=on go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei
```

In order to update the tool, you can use -u flag with `go get` command.


### From Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei.git
cd nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei/
go build .
mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/
nuclei -h
```

# Nuclei templates

You can download or update the nuclei templates using `update-templates` flag. 

```bash
> nuclei -update-templates
```

or download it from [nuclei templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) Github project.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates.git
```

**Please refer to [this guide](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) to writing your own custom templates.**

# Running nuclei

### 1. Running nuclei with a single template. 

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 

```bash
> nuclei -l urls.txt -t files/git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```

You can also pass the list of hosts at standard input (STDIN). This allows for easy integration in automation pipelines.

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 

```bash
> cat urls.txt | nuclei -t files/git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```

### 2. Running nuclei with multiple templates. 

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` with all the templates in the `path-to-templates` directory and returns the matched results. 

```bash
> nuclei -l urls.txt -t cves/ -o results.txt 
```

### 3. Automating nuclei with subfinder and any other similar tool.


```bash
> subfinder -d hackerone.com -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei -t cves/ -o results.txt
```

### Running in a Docker Container

You can use the [nuclei dockerhub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectdiscovery/nuclei). Simply run -

```bash
> docker pull projectdiscovery/nuclei
```

- After downloading or building the container, run the following:
```bash
> docker run -it projectdiscovery/nuclei
```

For example, this will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and output the results to your host file system:
```bash
> cat urls.txt | docker run -v /path-to-nuclei-templates:/go/src/app/ -i projectdiscovery/nuclei -t ./files/git-config.yaml > results.txt
```
Remember to change `/path-to-nuclei-templates` to the real path on your host file system.
