# Installation Instructions


## Direct Installation

### From Binary

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```bash
> tar -xzvf nuclei-linux-amd64.tar
> mv nuclei-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/nuclei
> nuclei -h
```

### From Source

nuclei requires go1.13+ to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```bash
> GO111MODULE=on go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/cmd/nuclei
```

In order to update the tool, you can use -u flag with `go get` command.

# Running nuclei

### 1. Running nuclei with a single template. 

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 

```bash
> nuclei -l urls.txt -t git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```


You can also pass the list of hosts at standard input (STDIN). This allows for easy integration in automation pipelines.

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 


```bash
> cat urls.txt | nuclei -t git-core.yaml -o results.txt
```

### 2. Running nuclei with a multiple template. 

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 

```bash
> nuclei -l urls.txt -t "path-to-templates/*.yaml" -o results.txt 
```


You can also pass the list of hosts at standard input (STDIN). This allows for easy integration in automation pipelines.

This will run the tool against all the hosts in `urls.txt` and returns the matched results. 


```bash
> cat urls.txt | nuclei -t "path-to-templates/*.yaml" -o results.txt 
```
